Cloud Load Balancing overview
A load balancer distributes user traffic across multiple instances of your applications. By spreading the load, load balancing reduces the risk that your applications experience performance issues.

About Cloud Load Balancing
By using Cloud Load Balancing, you can serve content as close as possible to your users on a system that can respond to over one million queries per second.
Cloud Load Balancing is a fully distributed, software-defined managed service. It isn't hardware-based, so you don't need to manage a physical load balancing infrastructure.
Google Cloud offers the following load balancing features:
•	Single IP address to serve as the frontend
•	Automatic intelligent autoscaling of your backends
•	External load balancing for when your users reach your applications from the internet
•	Internal load balancing for when your clients are inside of Google Cloud
•	Regional load balancing for when your applications are available in a single region
•	Global load balancing for when your applications are available across the world
•	Pass-through load balancing (see also direct server return (DSR) or direct routing)
•	Proxy-based load balancing (as an alternative to pass-through)
•	Layer 4-based load balancing to direct traffic based on data from network and transport layer protocols, such as IP address and TCP or UDP port
•	Layer 7-based load balancing to add content-based routing decisions based on attributes, such as the HTTP header and the uniform resource identifier
